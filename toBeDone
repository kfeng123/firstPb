1. Change "spiked covariance" to "spiked covariance matrices", "spiked covariance model" to "spiked covariance matrix model". This follows Cai et. al. (2015)
2. Bold the matrix notations
3. ref the section and appendix
4. asymptotic normality
5. simulation: 
    implement Lopes 2011 and other projection based methods, Ma 2015
    null distribution: QQ plot
    power simulation: both large sample size and small sample size
